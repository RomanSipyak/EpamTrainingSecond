**Task**

      1) To create Dependency Injection/IoC Container
      2) Container should have ability to choose an appropriate lifetime for each registered service:
      
**Transient**
      
      Transient lifetime services (RegisterTransient) are created each time they're requested from the service container.
      
**Singleton**
      
      Singleton lifetime services (RegisterSingleton) are created the first time they're requested.
      Every subsequent request uses the same instance.
